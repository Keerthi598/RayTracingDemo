## Ray Tracing Project (C++ / OpenGL)

A C++ OpenGL project demonstrating a basic ray tracing renderer with multiple light sources, shadow computation, and object reflections. This project was developed as part of a computer graphics class to explore fundamentals of ray tracing and 3D rendering.

### Overview
-   Custom 3D Scene Construction:
    Created objects (prisms, cubes, spheres) from scratch and positioned them in 3D space
-   Lighting & Shadows:  
    Two light sources with shadow calculations using double ray tracing
-   Reflection & Shading: 
    Implemented shine and reflection calculations to simulate realistic lighting
-   Camera Positioning:  
    Full control over camera placement and scene view

### Project Setup
 1. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Keerthi598/RayTracingDemo.git

 2. Open the project in Visual Studio
    
 3. Ensure you have OpenGL libraries linked correctly

 4. Build and run to render the scene

#### Note
This project renders a single pre-defined scene. No additional input is required.
